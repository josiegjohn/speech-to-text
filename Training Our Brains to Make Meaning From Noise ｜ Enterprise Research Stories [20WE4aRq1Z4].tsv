0	11600	When an older person is at a restaurant or a big family event, they really try their best
11600	16400	to understand everything going on, but at some point it just becomes too much and they
16400	20040	have shut themselves off from the rest of the family for the rest of that event.
20040	23760	That's what we want to stop.
23760	29980	In order to understand speech, that sound has to reach your brain and it has to be transmitted
29980	31940	correctly.
31940	36860	As you age, listening and paying attention becomes harder, especially when there's lots
36860	45660	of noise and Samira had noticed that how well your ears behave turns out not to have that
45660	51980	much to do with how well you understand what people are saying, especially in a noisy room.
51980	56780	We feel that merely just making sounds audible isn't enough.
56780	62780	We are trying to provide better tools for understanding what's happening for diagnosis.
62780	68620	MEG scanner captures the signal and then we can analyze that.
68620	74500	If we do find that older people have certain types of hearing difficulties, what we want
74500	78700	to do is intervene with targeted training strategies.
78700	83260	The subjects come here for the first session and then they go through the training session
83260	87340	and then again they come back for the second MEG session.
87340	90060	Some of it's an auditory cognitive training.
90060	95260	You're practicing listening to sounds to people talking in noisy background, but also you're
95260	99980	being asked not just to understand what they're saying, but to be able to use what they're
99980	106100	saying, which is what we need to do when we're really at a dinner or at a party.
106100	110780	We had our subject listen to sounds that were heavily distorted.
110780	119340	We can really see when certain sounds that are sentences do get turned into meaning.
119340	124500	What we can do is we can play those sounds from the competition and a wiser man would
124500	125500	have disbared.
125500	136180	We can play what the actual, natural, clear, undistorted sound was afterwards.
136180	141660	Just like you can improve physical health through exercise, we want to see if we can
141660	146300	induce changes in the way brain is processing sounds.
146300	150300	Because it's going to help them for better communication, because when you feel that
150300	157980	you cannot listen to hear to the other people talking, they start being isolated.
157980	162740	We're hoping that people will still be willing to engage, that they'll still be able to be
162740	169260	an active participant in family conversations, that they'll still go out to the theater and
169260	172780	restaurants and basically have a good quality of life.

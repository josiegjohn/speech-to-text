1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
When an older person is at a restaurant or a big family event, they really try their best

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,400
to understand everything going on, but at some point it just becomes too much and they

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,040
have shut themselves off from the rest of the family for the rest of that event.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,760
That's what we want to stop.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,980
In order to understand speech, that sound has to reach your brain and it has to be transmitted

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,940
correctly.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,860
As you age, listening and paying attention becomes harder, especially when there's lots

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:45,660
of noise and Samira had noticed that how well your ears behave turns out not to have that

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,980
much to do with how well you understand what people are saying, especially in a noisy room.

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,780
We feel that merely just making sounds audible isn't enough.

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,780
We are trying to provide better tools for understanding what's happening for diagnosis.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,620
MEG scanner captures the signal and then we can analyze that.

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,500
If we do find that older people have certain types of hearing difficulties, what we want

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,700
to do is intervene with targeted training strategies.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,260
The subjects come here for the first session and then they go through the training session

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,340
and then again they come back for the second MEG session.

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,060
Some of it's an auditory cognitive training.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,260
You're practicing listening to sounds to people talking in noisy background, but also you're

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,980
being asked not just to understand what they're saying, but to be able to use what they're

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,100
saying, which is what we need to do when we're really at a dinner or at a party.

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,780
We had our subject listen to sounds that were heavily distorted.

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:59,340
We can really see when certain sounds that are sentences do get turned into meaning.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,500
What we can do is we can play those sounds from the competition and a wiser man would

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
have disbared.

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:16,180
We can play what the actual, natural, clear, undistorted sound was afterwards.

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,660
Just like you can improve physical health through exercise, we want to see if we can

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,300
induce changes in the way brain is processing sounds.

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Because it's going to help them for better communication, because when you feel that

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,980
you cannot listen to hear to the other people talking, they start being isolated.

30
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,740
We're hoping that people will still be willing to engage, that they'll still be able to be

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,260
an active participant in family conversations, that they'll still go out to the theater and

32
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,780
restaurants and basically have a good quality of life.

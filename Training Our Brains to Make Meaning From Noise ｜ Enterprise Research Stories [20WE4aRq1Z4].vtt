When an older person is at a restaurant or a big family event, they really try their best

00:11.600 --> 00:16.400
to understand everything going on, but at some point it just becomes too much and they

00:16.400 --> 00:20.040
have shut themselves off from the rest of the family for the rest of that event.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.760
That's what we want to stop.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.980
In order to understand speech, that sound has to reach your brain and it has to be transmitted

00:29.980 --> 00:31.940
correctly.

00:31.940 --> 00:36.860
As you age, listening and paying attention becomes harder, especially when there's lots

00:36.860 --> 00:45.660
of noise and Samira had noticed that how well your ears behave turns out not to have that

00:45.660 --> 00:51.980
much to do with how well you understand what people are saying, especially in a noisy room.

00:51.980 --> 00:56.780
We feel that merely just making sounds audible isn't enough.

00:56.780 --> 01:02.780
We are trying to provide better tools for understanding what's happening for diagnosis.

01:02.780 --> 01:08.620
MEG scanner captures the signal and then we can analyze that.

01:08.620 --> 01:14.500
If we do find that older people have certain types of hearing difficulties, what we want

01:14.500 --> 01:18.700
to do is intervene with targeted training strategies.

01:18.700 --> 01:23.260
The subjects come here for the first session and then they go through the training session

01:23.260 --> 01:27.340
and then again they come back for the second MEG session.

01:27.340 --> 01:30.060
Some of it's an auditory cognitive training.

01:30.060 --> 01:35.260
You're practicing listening to sounds to people talking in noisy background, but also you're

01:35.260 --> 01:39.980
being asked not just to understand what they're saying, but to be able to use what they're

01:39.980 --> 01:46.100
saying, which is what we need to do when we're really at a dinner or at a party.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.780
We had our subject listen to sounds that were heavily distorted.

01:50.780 --> 01:59.340
We can really see when certain sounds that are sentences do get turned into meaning.

01:59.340 --> 02:04.500
What we can do is we can play those sounds from the competition and a wiser man would

02:04.500 --> 02:05.500
have disbared.

02:05.500 --> 02:16.180
We can play what the actual, natural, clear, undistorted sound was afterwards.

02:16.180 --> 02:21.660
Just like you can improve physical health through exercise, we want to see if we can

02:21.660 --> 02:26.300
induce changes in the way brain is processing sounds.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.300
Because it's going to help them for better communication, because when you feel that

02:30.300 --> 02:37.980
you cannot listen to hear to the other people talking, they start being isolated.

02:37.980 --> 02:42.740
We're hoping that people will still be willing to engage, that they'll still be able to be

02:42.740 --> 02:49.260
an active participant in family conversations, that they'll still go out to the theater and

02:49.260 --> 02:52.780
restaurants and basically have a good quality of life.

# speech-to-text



Here are my expansive thoughts. 
I picked a video about AI, even though it was 3 minutes which may have been a bit too long. But the text all makes sense, and the timestamps lined up, so I figure it did a good job. I don't know if I would choose this over otter.ai, but it's a good tool.
